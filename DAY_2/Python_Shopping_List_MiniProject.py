"""

Challenge 3
    User can enter SHOW or Show or show, 
    similar for DONE and HELP, but the program should do the required job

    Show the item in the list serially starting from 1

    Let us accept items using a comma separated string
        
    Also there should be a functionality to add an item at a specific index

    There should be a functionality to remove items from the list at a specific index using REMOVE
    
    Do all the exception handling for all the extreme use cases
