"Data science" is just about as broad of a term as they come. 
It may be easiest to describe what it is by listing its more concrete components:
    
Data Exploration & Analysis (EDA):

    Included here: Pandas; NumPy; SciPy; 
    
Data visualization: 
    A pretty self-explanatory name. 
    Taking data and turning it into something colorful.

    Included here: Matplotlib; Seaborn; Datashader; others.

Classical Machine Learning: 
    Conceptually, we could define this as any supervised or unsupervised learning 
    task that is not deep learning. 
    Scikit-learn is far-and-away the go-to tool for implementing classification, 
    regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction, 

    Included here: Scikit-Learn, StatsModels.


Deep learning. 
    This is a subset of machine learning that is seeing a renaissance, 
    and is commonly implemented with Keras, among other libraries. 
    It has seen monumental improvements over the last ~5 years, such as AlexNet in 2012, 
    which was the first design to incorporate consecutive convolutional layers.

    Included here: Keras, TensorFlow, and a whole host of others.


Reinforcement Learning
    

Data storage and big data frameworks. 
    Big data is best defined as data that is either literally too large to 
    reside on a single machine, 
    or can’t be processed in the absence of a distributed environment. 
    The Python bindings to Apache technologies play heavily here.

    Apache Spark; Apache Hadoop; HDFS; Dask; h5py/pytables.


Odds and ends. 
    Includes subtopics such as Natural Language Processing, 
    and Image Manipulation with libraries such as OpenCV.

    Included here: nltk; Spacy; OpenCV/cv2; scikit-image; Cython.

Introduce the concept of Scalar, Vectors and Tensors 
(Scalar_Vector_Tensor)

Scalar = When we want to store 1 piece of information ( value ) for a given physical quantity.
E.g. = Temperature and Pressure

Scalar has one component
Scalar is tensor of rank zero

Vector = When we want to store 2 piece of information ( value and direction ) 
for a given physical quantity.
E.g. = Position, Force and Velocity

v = v1*x + v2*y + v3z
[v1 v2 v3 ] as an array 

or 
as an columnar
[ v1 ]
[ v2 ]
[ v3 ]


Vector has three component
Vector is a Tensor of rank one, one basis vector per component

Tensor = When we want to store 3 piece of information 
( value and direction and plane ) for a given physical quantity.
E.g. = stress , forces in side an object    
[v11  v12  v13 ]
[v21  v22  v23 ]
[v31  v32  v33 ]


Tensor has nine component
Tensor is tensor of rank two


If the rank is three then the components are 27

"""
Difference between LIST and ARRAY 

Every array has one and only one dtype. 
All items in it should be of that dtype.

Once an array is created, you cannot change its size. 

You will have to create a new array or overwrite the existing one.

An equivalent numpy array occupies much less space than a python list of lists.

Arrays support VECTORIZED operations, while lists don’t.

Arrays are the main data structure used in machine learning.

In Python, arrays from the NumPy library, called N-dimensional arrays or the ndarray, 
are used as the primary data structure for representing data.

"""

# NumPy == Numerical Python
# library consisting of multidimensional array objects 
# and a collection of routines for processing those arrays. 

# Mathematical and logical operations on arrays.
# Fourier transforms and routines for shape manipulation
# NumPy has in-built functions for linear algebra and random number generation.


# NumPy – A Replacement for MatLab
# NumPy is often used along with packages like SciPy (Scientific Python) and 
# Matplotlib (plotting library).

# pip install numpy 


# N-dimensional array type called ndarray.
# It describes the collection of items of the same type.

Mean, Median, Mode

Let's create some fake income data, centered around 27,000 
with a normal distribution and standard deviation of 15,000, with 10,000 data points. 
Then, compute the mean (average)

Some of the properties of a standard normal distribution are mentioned below:

    The normal curve is symmetric about the mean and bell shaped.
    mean = median = mode is zero which is the centre of the curve.
    symmetry about the center
    50% of values less than the mean and 50% greater than the mean
    
    Approximately 68.26% of the data will be between -1 and +1 
    (i.e. within 1 standard deviation from the mean), 
    95.44% between -2 and +2 (within 2 SD from the mean) and 
    99.72% between -3 and 3 (within 3 SD from the mean)
    
    68 | 95 | 99.7 Rule
